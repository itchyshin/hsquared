# Changelog

## hsquared 0.0.0.9000

### New features

- [`animal()`](https://itchyshin.github.io/hsquared/reference/animal.md)
  is now exported as an inert formula marker, and
  [`hsquared()`](https://itchyshin.github.io/hsquared/reference/hsquared.md)
  now parses the narrow v0.1 formula contract
  `animal(1 | id, pedigree = ped)` before stopping at the planned Julia
  bridge boundary
  ([\#4](https://github.com/itchyshin/hsquared/issues/4),
  [\#6](https://github.com/itchyshin/hsquared/issues/6)).
- Added an internal R-to-Julia bridge payload builder for the v0.1
  animal-model contract. It creates `y`, `X`, sparse `Z`, normalized
  pedigree metadata, and the validated Julia `animal_model_spec()`
  target, but still does not execute Julia or fit models
  ([\#6](https://github.com/itchyshin/hsquared/issues/6)).
- Added Phase 0 project operating documentation, an honest placeholder
  [`hsquared()`](https://itchyshin.github.io/hsquared/reference/hsquared.md)
  entry point, and
  [`hs_control()`](https://itchyshin.github.io/hsquared/reference/hs_control.md)
  for planned engine controls.
